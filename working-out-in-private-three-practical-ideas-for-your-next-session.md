After a while, motivation drops and the once fun and rewarding experience, turns into a draining and agonizing activity. But it doesn’t have to be like this…

In this blog post, we’ll go over how you can avoid this sort of experience by showing you ways you can start working out privately. From home gyms, to outdoor workout spaces, we’re sure that we’ll help you find your new fitness haven!

### **Setting the right goal for your workouts** <a href="#_8o79np8r1lif" id="_8o79np8r1lif"></a>

Before looking at the different ideas for your private workout space, we should start by making sure we have your fitness goals in mind. This can help you make a more informed decision, since it can help you choose which space matches most with your wants and needs.

Make sure to get as detailed as possible, looking beyond just the gains you want to achieve, but also details such as the time frame, the way in which you want to reach this goal, and how you can track this goal. Additionally, using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely) goal framework can help make sure your goals are effective and reasonable. These details can make it easy to pick which sort of space is best for you, and can even speed up your progress.

Ultimately, since working out privately might not be something you’re already used to, having your goal in mind can also make sure that you don’t stray away too far from what your fitness journey is all about.

First, home gyms are an excellent choice to workout in private. While the typical idea of a home gym includes to lots of expensive equipment and investment, home gyms can also be very affordable and be adapted to any sort of space.

This can be as simple as having a couple of weights and a yoga mat. This is when your goals come into play, as you can invest in as much equipment as your goals require. Additionally, if you’re looking to stay frugal, you can rely more on calisthenics and body weight exercises, which can cut the amount of equipment required by a lot!

### **3. Working out at odd times** <a href="#_pq4tkjdf5ehz" id="_pq4tkjdf5ehz"></a>

If you’re still set on keeping your gym membership, we still have an option for you. If you’d like to workout with less of a crowd, you can try to workout in your public gym at different times. It varies by gym, but usually at a 24 hour gym, the gym can be a lot less crowded at certain times. For example, usually gyms can be very empty at a round 1-5am. Obviously, most people like to workout later in the day since thats what is usually convenient for people, but if you have the ability to wake up earlier and make time in your schedule, you can usually workout in almost completely empty gyms at these times.

This can be a plus if you want all the equipment you’re used to at a gym, but don’t want the people. Additionally, a gym membership can be a bit more affordable than the previous options, which can make it easier on your bank account. However, waking up this early may not be ideal for you or your schedule.

### **4. Outdoor gym spaces** <a href="#_t5wj3twmqt5r" id="_t5wj3twmqt5r"></a>

Finally, working out outdoors can also be a very good alternative to a public gym. Some ideas for an outdoor gym space could include an outdoor park with equipment that you can use to workout, but can also just be your own backyard. While some of these outdoor alternatives may not be as private as the other options, you can still avoid the large crowds that you’d find in a gym that would make it hard to get a full workout in.

Getting a space setup in your backyard can also be as simple as setting up your own home gym. By setting up a variety of equipment such as pull-up bars, free weights, etc., you can give yourself a challenging and diverse workout experience. Alternatively, you can utilize your body weight for exercises like push-ups and squats to target specific muscle groups, if you’re looking to save money.

### **Conclusion** <a href="#_46jeqwj4p5ky" id="_46jeqwj4p5ky"></a>

Looking for ways to workout without the crowds can be difficult at times, since gyms are conventionally public areas. However, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t alternatives! Additionally, make sure to take it slow when transitioning your workout space and/or your schedule, to make sure you have a smooth and natural transition.
