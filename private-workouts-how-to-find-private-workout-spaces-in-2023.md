#### **Seeking Secluded Outdoor Locations** <a href="#_30tlclwnczdn" id="_30tlclwnczdn"></a>

Explore nearby parks, nature trails, or open spaces that provide seclusion and privacy for outdoor workouts. Look for less crowded times or less frequented areas within these locations to ensure a more private experience. Be mindful of any local regulations or guidelines regarding outdoor workouts.

For example, at a park, you can usually find monkey bars which can be useful if you’re into calisthenics.
