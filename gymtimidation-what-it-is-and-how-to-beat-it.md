### **Introduction** <a href="#_3hl3rd4k0njp" id="_3hl3rd4k0njp"></a>

Going to the gym can be a daunting experience for many people. This can stem from several different factors, including (but not limited to) being new to working out, and being self-conscious about their appearance. This can also be experienced by those who are uncomfortable by people watching them at the gym. Whatever it may be, this feeling is holding many from working out and reaching their fitness goals.

This feeling of unease is commonly referred to as gymtimidation. This can eventually lead to an overall negative attitude towards exercise.

In this article, we’ll go over what gymtimidation is, and how to beat it once and for all to finally reach your fitness and gym goals!

### **What is gymtimidation?** <a href="#_gr443ov1ximm" id="_gr443ov1ximm"></a>

As mentioned before, gymtimidation is a feeling of self-consciousness and anxiety that occurs when people work out. However, this intimidation is not always exclusive to the gym. In a study conducted by[ Isopure](http://www.theisopurecompany.com/), they found that many people even feel intimidated while going for a run outside.

This feeling is a common one, with half of all americans experiencing this. Specifically, 32% of these Americans explain that they experience this while working out near someone extremely fit. Additionally, 17% is experienced while working out near someone of the opposite sex.

This feeling is generally faced because of a lack of confidence in their workouts and theirselves. This is intensified when people enter a gym with others who seemingly have better physiques and routines.
