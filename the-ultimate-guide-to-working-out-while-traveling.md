Usually, traveling can be a wonderful experience, giving you the opportunity to explore new places and experience different cultures. Other times, traveling can be unavoidable part of your life, whether its for school, work, or family. Whatever the reasons for your travels or vacationing may be, being on away can be very disruptive for your fitness routine.

Finding the time and motivation to workout during your time away can make it hard to maintain your routine. Not only that, but finding the right place to workout can also just make it impossible to even start. But don't worry, with a little planning and creativity, you can stay fit and healthy no matter where your travels take you.

#### **1. Plan Ahead** <a href="#_b7xk4r7or5c6" id="_b7xk4r7or5c6"></a>

Before you set off on your trip or vacation, take some time to research the fitness options available at your destination. Look for gyms or fitness centers near your hotel, or check if your hotel has a gym or fitness facilities. You can also look for outdoor fitness activities like hiking or running trails, or even yoga studios. Planning ahead will help you stay motivated and focused on your fitness goals.

If you're planning on going to a new city, you can use online resources like Yelp or Google Maps to find fitness centers and gyms in the area. You can also look up fitness events or classes that may be happening during your stay. By doing some research beforehand, you'll be able to plan your workouts and stay on track with your fitness goals.

#### **2. Try alternative fitness spaces** <a href="#_en2extsrcxoy" id="_en2extsrcxoy"></a>

While you may be used to using commercial gyms to get your workouts in, it may not be the best option for your situation while traveling. For example, going to a commercial gym while away may require you to buy a membership, which might not be convenient if you’re not staying for too long. Instead, a private gym may be more suitable for your situation.

Private gyms are home gyms that you can rent in the are you’re traveling to. Not only does this give you a private gym experience, but it also allows you to save money on a membership, since you only have to pay for the individual bookings. From yoga studios to weight rooms, you can get a full experience without the hassle of memberships with a private gym! Look for your first private gym today at[ Gym2Gym.com](http://gym2gym.com/)!

#### **3. Pack a Fitness Kit** <a href="#_dw3jr0okxa6g" id="_dw3jr0okxa6g"></a>

Packing a small fitness kit can help you stay on track with your workouts while on the go. Resistance bands, jump ropes, and yoga mats are lightweight and easy to pack. You can also bring portable workout equipment like kettlebells or dumbbells if you have the space. Having these tools on hand will make it easier to fit in a quick workout whenever you have some free time.

If you're short on space, there are also many bodyweight exercises that you can do without any equipment. Push-ups, squats, lunges, and planks are all great exercises that you can do in your hotel room or even in a park. This can ultimately help you stay on track, and keep it convenient for your vacationing or traveling, as long as you have the space for it.

This can make it easier to stay consistent, since even if you aren’t able to find a typical gym or a home gym near you, these simple fitness kits can be a replacement.

#### **4. Make Fitness a Part of Your Trip** <a href="#_fjbbfspfk0g9" id="_fjbbfspfk0g9"></a>

One of the best ways to stay motivated while traveling is to make fitness a part of your trip. Look for opportunities to be active, like taking a walking tour of the city or exploring local parks and hiking trails.

You can also try new activities like surfing, paddleboarding, or rock climbing. With many hotels and resorts offering pools to guests, this could be a fun and easy way to incorporate activities and sweat while away. By incorporating fitness into your travel plans, you'll not only stay healthy but also have a more immersive and enjoyable experience.

If you're traveling with friends or family, get them involved in your fitness routine. You can all go for a hike, take a yoga class together, or even rent bikes and explore the city. Not only will you be able to stay fit, but you'll also create lasting memories with your loved ones.

#### **5. Make yourself a schedule** <a href="#_snyuh9bjmfdv" id="_snyuh9bjmfdv"></a>

While traveling, it can be difficult to maintain healthy habits, especially if you’re on vacation. Being in a new environment can make it harder to stay in the same mindset and headspace that allowed you to maintain your fitness routines.

Because of this, we suggest setting that you make a schedule. This can be as simple as outlining the routine and split that you’ll be using and want to stick to during your trip.

Make sure to include where you’ll be going, the facilities you want to use, and the workouts you’ll want to be doing.

By doing so, you can make it easier for yourself to stick to your routine, since you know exactly what you’ll be doing and where you’ll go.

You can also use technology to help you do so. On the Gym2Gym app, you can make yourself a schedule by booking gyms in advance that have facilities that you want to use.

This will automatically make a schedule for you on the app, which can help you visualize where you’ll be going and what your week will look like.

Making a schedule is also important if you’re busy while traveling. For example, if you’re traveling for work and have things to do, writing down how you’ll work around your busy schedule can make it easier to work around your other duties and make your trips more organized.

#### **6. Choose healthy food options** <a href="#_o0nrite936b8" id="_o0nrite936b8"></a>

While traveling, it's easy to indulge in unhealthy foods, especially when you’re on vacation with limited food options. However, its important to keep your fitness goals in mind. Going the extra mile to pick the healthy options may not always be the most fun option, but you will be thanking yourself in the long run.

Try to pack healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, or protein bars, so that you have healthy options on hand. If you’re eating out, look for healthier options like grilled or baked dishes instead of fried ones. You can also use apps like Yelp or TripAdvisor to find restaurants that offer healthy meals in the area. Additionally, eating a healthy diet can help you feel energized, and stay on track with your fitness goals.

However, we should mention, while eating health is important, it is also completely fine to let yourself have some fun and indulge here and there. Of course, its best to practice discipline with your diet, but having fun is also very important while traveling, and in general!

#### **10. Have Fun!** <a href="#_y2nd4pr6rsut" id="_y2nd4pr6rsut"></a>

Above all, have fun! Traveling is an opportunity to experience new things, and working out can be a part of that experience.

Try new activities like dancing or beach volleyball, or explore a new city on foot. Having fun and being active can help you stay motivated, and make your trip even more memorable.
