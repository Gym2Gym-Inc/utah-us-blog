### Visually Capture Your Space <a href="#_tj7yzk8uksxk" id="_tj7yzk8uksxk"></a>

When listing your gym on Gym2Gym, the first thing potential renters will notice is the picture posted on your listing. So, it’s really important that you make sure you have the right pictures that show off exactly what your gym is about!

Ensure your photos are clear, high-quality, and effectively showcase your facilities. Include pictures of people using equipment and the general vibe of your gym. Additionally, you can try editing the pictures to enhance their appeal using the built-in features on your phone or use third-party apps like VSCO. This way, you can make your pictures stand out and be visually aesthetic!

Ensuring your images are appealing and high quality with simple details like lighting, framing, etc., you’ll easily be able to attract new clients and trainers.

### Perfect Your Description <a href="#_ai1nqcvxzjgx" id="_ai1nqcvxzjgx"></a>

Crafting the perfect description is essential for an effective Gym2Gym listing. Mention all available amenities and be honest – avoid any exaggeration that could lead to bad reviews. Users may feel deceived if your description isn’t entirely accurate, which can hurt your business.

Also, don’t forget to highlight the unique aspects of your gym. Why should people choose your gym? If there's something that is specific to your gym or some policy that you stick to, make sure to mention it so people know!

Finally, explain the entry process and clearly state your rules. If you have a lock code, make sure to mention that it will be sent after they rent your gym (note: do not include the code in the description, as it’ll be publicly displayed to everyone). Lastly, make sure to include any rules you have and accessibility options so people know before they pay, to maintain transparency.

### Set Your Schedule and Pricing <a href="#_6wl3v18w4qmy" id="_6wl3v18w4qmy"></a>

Finally, your listing should include a schedule that not only works best for you but also aligns with popular availability preferences. Gym-goers generally like to workout in the mornings and around 4-7 p.m. on weekdays. Try to use that information to tailor when you can make your gym available for your customers.

Additionally, make sure you price your gym reasonably. Watch how your competitors price their facilities while also reflecting on your own. If your gym offers advanced features, classes, or equipment, let this be reflected in your pricing. But if it's on the lower end, make sure that it also reflects that.
