### **Introduction** <a href="#_v6ml1s84h9ad" id="_v6ml1s84h9ad"></a>

With fitness becoming more popular, the gym has become the default place for people to recommend when people are looking to start their fitness journey. But is this really the only way to get fit?

For many, it is. But for another majority (and maybe even you), the gym isn’t always convenient or possible for them. Additionally, with the COVID-19 pandemic, more people have started to look at the alternatives, in order to stay safe while maintaining their workout schedule.

In this blog post, we will look at one alternative — working out at home. We’ll look at the benefits of working out at home, why someone would choose home over the gym, and how you can make the most out of your space to get the ultimate workouts in.

### **Before you start: consider your fitness goals** <a href="#_a4ws9ywqu9vn" id="_a4ws9ywqu9vn"></a>

Before beginning its important to consider what your fitness goals are. Are you looking to gain muscle? Or maybe you’re looking to burn fat?

Whatever you goals may be, make sure to clearly have them in mind (whether you’re new on your journey, or have been working out for a while), when making a decision on where you want to workout. This will also help make sure whatever you choose is right for you and help you get to where you want to be easier and effectively.

### **Advantages of home gyms** <a href="#_cuub05uy26op" id="_cuub05uy26op"></a>

#### **1. Convenience** <a href="#_9xot5a99yfnc" id="_9xot5a99yfnc"></a>

One of the biggest advantages of working out at home is convenience. You don't have to worry about getting dressed, driving to the gym, or dealing with crowds. You can work out whenever you want, without having to wait for equipment or deal with other people's schedules. This is especially true for people with busy schedules, as it allows them to fit in a workout whenever they have time. The convenience also allows you to reduce the amount of hassle to get started, if commitment to the gym is something that you have trouble with.

However, we should note that this could also be something that makes it harder to stay consistent. People can tend to get lazy with workouts at home, since its in a familiar space. When you’re in the gym, you’re able to solely focus on the workout, while at home, you may have more distractions, resulting in lower quality workouts overall. However, this varies per person, and can be mitigated with a specific workout space.

When considering the convenience of gyms versus working out at home, its important to weigh the quality of workouts you’ll potentially get from home gyms versus normal gyms, against the convenience of being able to workout at home.

#### **2. Equipment** <a href="#_en5ciynkgp7d" id="_en5ciynkgp7d"></a>

Another factor to consider when deciding whether to work out at home or at the gym is equipment. At the gym, you have access to a wide variety of machines and equipment, which can help you target a variety of muscle groups and achieve your fitness goals. Additionally, gyms often have trainers who can help you create a workout plan and guide you through exercises.

However, working out at home doesn't necessarily mean you have to sacrifice quality equipment. You can purchase your own equipment, such as dumbbells, resistance bands, and yoga mats, to create a private gym. While this can be an investment, it can also save you money in the long run by eliminating the need for a gym membership. However, working out at home can be difficult if you’re looking for a full workout, but don’t want to put in large investments.

If this is a problem you’re facing, but are looking for a private gym experience, there still exist alternatives. Using[ Gym2Gym](http://gym2gym.com/)’s platform, you can look for private gyms near you that have a variety of equipment and facilities, while only putting a fraction of the cost to use them. Additionally, Gym2Gym allows you to look for **private trainers** that can meet you at the private gyms to help you get a better workout in.

#### **3. Motivation** <a href="#_bkux482apgl6" id="_bkux482apgl6"></a>

As mentioned before, motivation is a key factor in staying consistent with a workout routine. Home gyms can lead to a lack of motivation and laziness, while going to the gym can provide motivation by creating a social environment and holding you accountable for showing up. Additionally, seeing other people working out can be inspiring and push you to work harder.

At home, it can be easy to get distracted or lose motivation, especially if you don't have a designated space for working out. However, some people find that working out at home provides more motivation because they can create a personalized space that suits their needs and preferences.

Additionally, working out at home can eliminate the **fear of judgment or embarrassment** that some people may feel at the gym. Working out at home can also provide motivation if you face this sort of intimidation as it reduces the distractions from others, and makes it easier to focus only on yourself. We advise that you look to find designated spaces within your home, or spaces for rent through our platform, in order to make sure you can stay focused on the workout, and reduce outside distractions.

#### **4. Hygiene** <a href="#_xyqlvttj8d2i" id="_xyqlvttj8d2i"></a>

One of the biggest concerns with working out at the gym is the **potential for germs and bacteria** on equipment and surfaces. While gyms do their best to regularly clean and disinfect equipment, it can still be a worry for some people, particularly after the pandemic.

On the other hand, when you work out at home, you have complete control over the cleanliness of your workout space. You can easily sanitize your equipment before and after use, and keep your space clean and hygienic.

However, it’s important to note that simply being at home doesn't automatically mean that your workout space is clean and hygienic. It’s important to regularly clean any equipment you use at home to maintain a hygienic environment and reduce the risk of illness or infection. This means wiping down your weights, mats, and any other equipment you may use with disinfectant wipes or spray. Its important to keep this in mind, and that choosing to work out at home with equipment also comes with this responsibility.

Overall, while working out at home may offer more control over hygiene, it still requires an active effort to maintain a clean and safe environment. However, with proper care and attention, you can create a hygienic workout space that is tailored to your needs and preferences, and eliminate any concerns about hygiene or cleanliness that you may have about working out at the gym.

### **Conclusion** <a href="#_5gn8is4q58ja" id="_5gn8is4q58ja"></a>

Ultimately, the decision of whether to work out at home or at the gym depends on personal preference and individual circumstances. Working out at home can provide convenience and eliminate the need for a gym membership, while going to the gym can provide access to quality equipment and a motivating environment. Ultimately, the most important factor is consistency and finding a routine that works best for you.
