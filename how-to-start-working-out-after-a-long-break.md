But don’t worry, you’re not alone. Many people experience fitness setbacks at some point in their lives.

Before starting with the rest of the tips, we should mention that if you stopped because of an injury or other medical related reason, it would be a good idea to speak with a doctor in order to make sure it's safe for you to jump back in.

This is to make sure that working out is 100% safe, and there's a reduced risk for any further medical setbacks. Additionally, your doctor can advise you on what types of exercises are safe and suitable for you, and what precautions you should take. They can also help you monitor your progress and adjust your workout plan as needed.

### **1. Start slow and easy** <a href="#_nr4rqfbooxjb" id="_nr4rqfbooxjb"></a>

One of the most common mistakes people make when returning to exercise after a long break is doing too much too soon. This is especially true if you have lots of experience with lifting heavier weights. But it's important to listen to your body and take it slow at this stage.

Going too hard too fast can lead to soreness, fatigue, injury, and frustration, which can hurt your progress at an early stage. Instead of trying to pick up where you left off, start slow and easy. Begin with low-intensity exercises that don’t put too much stress on your muscles and joints, such as walking, cycling, swimming, or yoga. Gradually increase the duration, frequency, and intensity of your workouts as your fitness level improves.

Doing this can help you start on the right track and reduce the chances of injury.

### **2. Try working out at home** <a href="#_4e8d91tlsbog" id="_4e8d91tlsbog"></a>

### **3. Set goals for yourself** <a href="#_qf401ekumnca" id="_qf401ekumnca"></a>

Working out after a long break can be hard, but it can also be rewarding. In order to keep yourself motivated and focused, set goals for yourself. This will help you remember why you’re doing it in the first place, and maintain a consistent focus for what you’re doing.

What are your goals? How do you want to feel? What benefits do you expect to get from exercising? Write down your reasons and keep them somewhere visible, such as on your fridge, mirror, or phone wallpaper. Remind yourself of them whenever you feel like giving up or skipping a workout.

This could be anything, from getting more lean, building more muscle, or being more healthy in general. Whatever it may be, this can help you not only stay motivated, but also make more informed decisions around your fitness and your journey as a whole.

### **4. Prepare in advance** <a href="#_9669azm2mhyl" id="_9669azm2mhyl"></a>

One of the best ways to make working out after a long break easier is to prepare in advance. This means planning your workouts ahead of time, scheduling them in your calendar, setting reminders or alarms, and having everything you need ready to go. For example, you can pack your gym bag the night before, lay out your workout clothes in the morning, or download a fitness app or playlist on your phone.

By eliminating any obstacles or excuses that might prevent you from working out, you’ll increase your chances of sticking to your plan, and reduce the likelihood of backing out from your plans. Additionally, setting plans with a gym buddy can make it easier for you to show up, since they can hold you accountable, and motivate you.

### **5. Mix it up** <a href="#_2t783cts40fh" id="_2t783cts40fh"></a>

Doing the same workout over and over again can get boring and stale. To keep things interesting and fun, mix up your routine with different types of exercises. For example, you can alternate between cardio and strength training days, try new classes or videos online, or join a group or club that shares your interests. Or, if you only did weight training before, maybe you can try incorporating some sort of sports into your fitness journey to stay fit. This can spice up your routine and make it more exciting and enjoyable, making it easier to stay motivated.

Additionally, by varying your workouts, you’ll also challenge different muscles and avoid plateaus.

### **6. Reward yourself** <a href="#_klce5ft4kjcl" id="_klce5ft4kjcl"></a>

Finally, working out after a long break is not easy. It takes courage, discipline, and perseverance. That’s why you should reward yourself for every step you take towards your fitness goals. Celebrate your achievements, big and small, with something that makes you happy and proud. It could be anything from buying new workout gear to treating yourself to a massage to sharing your progress with friends or family. Just make sure your rewards are healthy and aligned with your goals.

Working out after a long break can be daunting but also exciting. You have the opportunity to rediscover your passion for fitness and reap the benefits of a healthier and happier lifestyle.
