Ever feel intimidated when walking into the gym? Well, you’re not alone. Many people share the same feeling, especially at the beginning of their fitness journey. However, this gym anxiety can be conquered. In this post, we’ll go over how to deal with gym anxiety once and for all. Using the gym anxiety tips in this post, we guarantee that you’ll be able to overcome your fears, and finally tackle your new years resolutions!

### **Focus on your progress** <a href="#_mgfbiageoqed" id="_mgfbiageoqed"></a>

The most important thing when it comes to gym anxiety is to focus on yourself. Remember that everyone in the gym is there to better themselves, just like you. Not only that, but everyone is way too worried about themselves to really pay much attention to you.

It's easy to feel self-conscious though, when you see people who seem to be more fit. But you have to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and has felt this sort of gym intimidation or “gymtimidation” before. So, instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own progress. Set small goals for yourself and celebrate each accomplishment, no matter how small.

If you’re feeling anxious about going to the gym, it may be because you don’t feel confident in the workouts you’re doing. Finding the right private trainer can help combat this, as it will help you figure out where you may be lacking while working out in the gym. Even fitness veterans can benefit from some pointers from professionals sometimes.

### **Find the right gym buddy** <a href="#_b4a83fwacvtr" id="_b4a83fwacvtr"></a>

Another way to conquer gym anxiety is to find a workout buddy. Having someone to exercise with can make the gym feel less intimidating. Not only can a workout buddy provide motivation and support, but they can also teach you new exercises and techniques. Plus, working out with a friend can make the gym feel more fun and less like a chore.

However, make sure that its the right gym buddy. A good gym partner has similar gym related goals, is reliable, and is someone you actually like, while a bad gym buddy can lead to a lack of motivation and progress, while a good gym buddy can help you progress even faster and push you further than you would go on your own.

### **Explore private gyms** <a href="#_y64l1crgu6hd" id="_y64l1crgu6hd"></a>

Finally, you can try private gyms. While traditional gyms have their own benefits, private gyms can provide a new fitness experience. They allow you to get a good workout in without having to deal with pressure and anxiety that comes with working out with others. Private gyms can also provide a variety of different sorts of equipment and facilities, compared to what you would usually find in a normal gym.
